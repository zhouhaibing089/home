I don't want to do all of customization again and again:

1. tmux configurations and themes.
1. vim configurations and themes.
1. installed brew packages.

## Map Caps to Ctrl

```console
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options "['ctrl:nocaps']"
```

On macOS:

System Settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Modifier Keys
